# Python-Project
Introduction
In this project conducted during my internship at ZidiO Development, I focused on customer segmentation for an E-commerce platform. The objective was to understand customer behavior through data analysis and clustering techniques. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing patterns and search behaviors, the project aimed to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer engagement.

Purpose
The purpose of this project was to leverage data science methodologies to:

Gain insights into customer preferences and behaviors.
Segment customers into distinct groups based on their interactions with the E-commerce platform.
Enable data-driven decision-making for marketing and customer relationship strategies.
Methodology
Data Loading and Exploration:

Loaded the dataset and conducted initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and contents.
Examined data quality, handled missing values, and performed basic statistical analyses.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned the data by addressing duplicates and missing values.
Transformed categorical variables and prepared numerical data for further analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized distributions of key variables such as gender, order frequency, and brand interactions using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Investigated correlations between variables using heatmap visualization.
Feature Engineering:

Engineered new features, such as 'Total Search', to enrich the dataset and capture cumulative customer behaviors.
Data Scaling:

Applied MinMax scaling to normalize numerical features for clustering algorithms.
Clustering (KMeans):

Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Implemented KMeans clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavioral patterns.
Results Interpretation:

Analyzed and interpreted the clusters to understand distinct customer segments.
Visualized top customers based on total searches and their cluster assignments for actionable insights.
Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into customer segmentation for the E-commerce platform. By effectively clustering customers based on their behaviors and preferences, we can now tailor marketing strategies and personalize customer interactions to enhance overall satisfaction and engagement. The methodology employed in this project demonstrates the power of data science in deriving meaningful insights from complex datasets, thereby contributing to informed decision-making and strategic planning in E-commerce businesses.
